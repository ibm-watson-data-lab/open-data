# open-data

Open data sets, tools, and discussion hosted by IBM Cloud Data Services (CDS).

While [Analytics Exchange](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/data/exchange/) is the primary site for finding and using open data sets with IBM's cloud databases, here you can find processing tools, sample apps and scripts, and smaller, *ad-hoc* test data sets.

Each directory has it's own specific README.md file describing its contents and purpose.
